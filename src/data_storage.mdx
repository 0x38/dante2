Date storage is an option that handles the way on how dante editor will hit your server to save the content, it will send an editorState serialized as json and a text version. Ajax calls are made with Axios library.
Ajax storage behavior can be overrided in order to integrate a custom solution with the save_handler callback.


```
data_storage: {
  failure_handler: func,
  interval: 1500,
  success_handler: func,
  url: string with your endpoint
  save_handler: func (editorContext, content)
  method: "POST"
  withCredentials: bool
  crossDomain: bool
  headers: {}
}
```
