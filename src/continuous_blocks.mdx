# Continuous Blocks

This config will enable the continuous creation of blocks when you create a new line. 
Usually you will not change this config.


## Defaults are : 
```
 [
   unstyled,
   blockquote,
   ordered-list,
   unordered-list,
   unordered-list-item,
   ordered-list-item,
   code-block
 ]
```

## But let's implement a continuous H1

<Playground>
  <Dante 
    content={h1}
    debug={true}
    continuousBlocks={[ "header-one" ]}
  />
</Playground>
